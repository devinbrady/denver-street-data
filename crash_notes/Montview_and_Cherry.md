"How long does it take for crash reports to get published? Specifically, Iâ€™m interested in a crash between a bicyclist and a Jeep driver at Montview & Cherry on 5/29. One of our Bike Busses takes this crossing and they have trouble getting drivers to stop for them. Just curious about who was at fault in the report."
